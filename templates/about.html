        <p>An About Us page isn’t just where you share the story of your brand. It’s also where you tell your customer what you do for them<strong> </strong>and how you work to meet their needs in that area.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>It isn’t so much “Here’s what we’re about,” but more like “Here’s who we are, why we started, and what we can do for you.”</p>
        
        
        
        <p>This page can go by many other names, by the way:&nbsp;</p>
        
        
        
        <ul>
        <li>“Our Mission”</li>
        
        
        
        <li>“Our Story”</li>
        
        
        
        <li>“About [brand name]”&nbsp;</li>
        
        
        
        <li>Or simply “About”</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        
        <p>An About Us page can include a wide array of information, but the most common sections to include are:</p>
        
        
        
        <ul>
        <li>Who you serve and what you do for them.</li>
        
        
        
        <li>Your brand story/history, including how you got started.</li>
        
        
        
        <li>Your mission and vision for the company.</li>
        
        
        
        <li>Your brand values, what you believe in, and how you uphold those values in your day-to-day operations.</li>
        
        
        
        <li>Mini bios of the people on your team.</li>
        
        
        
        <li>An explanation of your process, how your services work, or how your products are made.</li>

        </ul>
